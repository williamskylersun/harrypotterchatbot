GenAI Conversational Chatbot To Sharing Harry Potter Knowledge

In addition to his regular coursework, William attended a Generative AI class this fall, where he gained valuable skills in areas such as large language models, compound AI systems, and interactive applications. He also received a certificate for Build Web Apps with Generative AI. Leveraging these learnings, William went the extra mile to create an engaging conversational chatbot focused on the Harry Potter universe.

Driven by his passion for the Harry Potter franchise, William utilized techniques such as Retrieval Augmented Generation, LangChain, and vector embedding to develop a chatbot that provides accurate and detailed responses to a wide range of wizarding world-related questions. He also built a user-friendly Python Streamlit interface to enable seamless interactions for Harry Potter fans.

This extracurricular achievement showcases William's initiative, problem-solving abilities, and passion for applying his generative AI knowledge to a topic he cares deeply about, going above and beyond his regular curriculum.
